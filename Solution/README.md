# Random Folder

The `Random` folder contains various Python scripts that demonstrate different algorithms and problem-solving techniques. Each file is a standalone example of a specific method or approach. Below is a brief description of each file:

## Files and Descriptions

1. **backtracking.py**
   - Demonstrates the N-Queens problem using the backtracking approach.
   - Places N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

2. **branch_and_bound.py**
   - Solves a simplified version of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the branch and bound method.
   - Finds the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

3. **brute_force.py**
   - Demonstrates solving problems using the brute force approach.
   - Tries all possible solutions to find the correct one.

4. **divide_and_conquer.py**
   - Implements the Merge Sort algorithm using the divide and conquer approach.
   - Divides the array into halves, sorts them recursively, and merges them.

5. **dynamic_programming.py**
   - Calculates the Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming.
   - Uses memoization to store previously computed values for efficiency.

6. **genetic_algorithm.py**
   - Demonstrates a genetic algorithm to solve a simple optimization problem.
   - Uses selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve solutions over generations.

7. **greedy_algorithm.py**
   - Solves the Coin Change problem using the greedy algorithm approach.
   - Selects the largest coin denomination at each step to minimize the number of coins used.

8. **heuristics.py**
   - Demonstrates the A* algorithm, a heuristic-based search algorithm.
   - Finds the shortest path from a start node to a goal node using a cost function.

9. **machine_learning.py**
   - Implements a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn.
   - Fits a line to the data points to predict target values based on input features.

## How to Use

Each file is self-contained and can be executed independently. To run a specific script, navigate to the `Random` folder and execute the file using Python:

```bash
python <filename>.py
```

Replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you want to run.

## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to provide examples of different algorithms and techniques for learning and reference. These scripts are useful for understanding the implementation of various problem-solving methods in Python.
