#  In Python, an array is a data structure used to store a collection of elements, each identified
#  by an index or a key. Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not have a
#  built-in array type. Instead, the most commonly used array-like data structure is the list.
#  A list in Python is a dynamic array, meaning it can change in size during runtime. Elements
#  in a list can be of different data types, and you can perform various operations such as
#  adding, removing, or modifying elements. Lists are defined using square brackets [] and
#  can be indexed and sliced to access specific elements or sublists.
#  Example of a simple list in Python:
#  my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Finding Sum of Array Using  sum()

arr = [1, 2, 3]

ans = sum(arr)
print("Sum of array is: ", ans)
