# Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on an individual's weight and
#  height. It is commonly used as a screening tool to categorize individuals into different weight
#  status categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity.
#  The BMI is calculated using the following formula.
# BMI = 
# Weight (kg)
# / Height (m)2

# Alternatively, in the imperial system
# BMI = 
#  Weight (lb) / Height (in)^2 Ã—703

# BMI provides a general indication of body fatness but does not directly measure body fat or
#  distribution. It is widely used in public health and clinical settings as a quick and simple tool
#  to assess potential health risks associated with weight. Different BMI ranges are associated
#  with different health categories, but it's important to note that BMI has limitations and does
#  not account for factors such as muscle mass or distribution of fat.
