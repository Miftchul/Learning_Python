#  The factorial of a non-negative integer ( n ) is the product of all positive integers less than or
#  equal to ( n ). It is denoted by ( n! ) and is defined as:
#  𝑛! = 𝑛×(𝑛−1)×(𝑛−2)×…×3×2×1
#  For example:
#  5! = 5×4×3×2×1=120
#  0! is defined to be 1.
#  Factorials are commonly used in mathematics, especially in combinatorics and probability,
#  to count the number of ways a set of elements can be arranged or selected.

# Factorial of a number using recursion
